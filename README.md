Hello World !
Viti is a virtual assistant that helps you to search something on web or it can also take you to any website,
It helps you to install a package on your linux computer and it also helps to upgrade and update the system.
I will soon add more features to it like playing media and AI based game to kill your boredom.

To Run:
Go to the terminal and 'CD' to the Viti  folder.

then type :

##Now its the time to command Viti,
